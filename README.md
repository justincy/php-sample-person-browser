#PHP Sample Person Browser

This is a simple app built using the [FamilySearch PHP SDK](https://github.com/justincy/fs-php-sdk). It shows how to:
* Authenticate using OAuth2
* Navigate the discovery links
* Read people and relationships

This app is deployed at http://fs-php-sample-app.aws.af.cm/

This sample app uses the sandbox reference. If you don't see any relationships after logging in, visit https://sandbox.familysearch.org/tree and add some. If you don't have access to the sandbox and would like to begin development with the FamilySearch APIs, visit https://familysearch.org/developers to get started.

This repo is setup to run on [appfog](http://appfog.com) but it can easily be run locally. You will need to modify the devkey and oauth2 redirect uri to work in your new environment.
